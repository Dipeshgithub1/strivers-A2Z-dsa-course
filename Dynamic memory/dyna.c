//Dynamic Memory Allocation can be defined as a procedure in which the size of a data structure (like Array) is changed during the runtime.

//There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under <stdlib.h> header file to facilitate dynamic memory allocation in C programming. They are: 

//malloc() = memory allocation
//calloc()
//free()
//realloc()

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{

    // This pointer will hold the
    // base address of the block created
    int* ptr;
    int n, i;

    // Get the number of elements for the array
    printf("Enter number of elements:");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Entered number of elements: %d\n", n);

    // Dynamically allocate memory using malloc()
    ptr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    // Check if the memory has been successfully
    // allocated by malloc or not
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory not allocated.\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    else {

        // Memory has been successfully allocated
        printf("Memory successfully allocated using malloc.\n");

        // Get the elements of the array
        for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ptr[i] = i + 1;
        }

        // Print the elements of the array
        printf("The elements of the array are: ");
        for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            printf("%d, ", ptr[i]);
